## Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop a machine learning system to classify image data into 151 distinct Pokémon using:
- Image preprocessing (Image Resizing, Horizontal Flipping, Rotation, etc.)
- Stratified data sampling

**Key Features**:
- Handles raw image 
- Implements balanced dataset splitting (80%/20% stratified splits)
- Prepares image for ML models through cropping, resizing, flipping and rotation 
- Supports the 151 unique Pokémon in Generation 1.
